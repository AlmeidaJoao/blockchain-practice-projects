### ABOUT THE EXERCISE/PRACTICE PROJECT
This is an NFT smart contract example. The NFT Collection Name is "Spacebear" and the contract allows to add various images as NFTs under this collection. The smart contract follows [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) specs.
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
For this project, there is a set of tools required to run the project. Follow the instructions in the following sections to get it all setup.

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you'll need to have `node`(v12 or later)  & `npm` installed. 
To check if the tools have been installed, run the following commands on a terminal window:
```sh
npm -v
node -v
git --version
```
If an error or a message is displayed instead of a version output, it means you'll have to install them. You can search how to install them on Windows & Mac. The commands shown in this section  were run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. For Windows, you can run on an WSL terminal.

To install this tools, run the following commands (Linux):
```sh
sudo apt install node
```
```sh
sudo apt install npm
```

### Install Hardhat
To install `hardhat`, run the following command:
```sh
sudo npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
Hardhat will be used as a dev dependency.

### Running the project
Before starting the project, run the following commands:
```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```
After compiling the smart contract, you'll need to start a hardhat node to deploy the smart contract afterwards
```sh
npx hardhat node
```
On a separate terminal, run the following command
```sh
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
```
After running this command, the nft smart contract will run in the hardhat development blockchain environment. But we can run this on a different blockchain network, for example, [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/). To run on a different network, just configure the `hardhat.config.js` file with the ganache network parameters.
